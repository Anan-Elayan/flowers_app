✨ My Latest Project: A Flower Shopping App 🌸📱

I’m excited to share my latest project – a mobile app built with Flutter for a school student. The app is a flower shop that provides a simple and complete experience for both admins and users.

App Features:
1️⃣ For the Admin:

Add photos of items to sell.
Edit or delete items.
View orders received.
2️⃣ For the User:

Browse flowers available in the shop.
Add flowers to the cart.
Confirm purchases easily.
💾 Technology Used:
The app uses SharedPreferences for internal device storage to manage data and operations efficiently without needing a server connection.

Project Goals:
Provide a simple and fast solution for managing a local shop.
Offer a smooth user experience with an easy-to-use interface.
✨ This project was a great opportunity to improve my Flutter skills and explore device storage capabilities.
What do you think of the project? 😊 I’d love to hear your feedback or any suggestions for improvement!
